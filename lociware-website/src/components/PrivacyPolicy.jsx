        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Where we refer to “process”, it means how we collect, use, store, make available, destroy, update, disclose, or otherwise deal with your personal information. As a rule, we will only process your personal information if this is required to deliver or offer a service, provide a product, or carry out a transaction.
        </p>

          We may combine your personal information and use the combined personal information for any of the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.

          If you use our services, goods, products, and service channels, you agree that we may process your personal information as explained under this Privacy Policy. Sometimes you may provide us with consent to process your personal information. Read it carefully because it may limit your rights.

        </p>
        <p>
          Where you have provided your consent for the processing of your personal information, you may withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we will explain the consequences to you.
